# Conflicts, merging and rebasing
### Merge main into the greet branch
```
git checkout greet
```
```
git merge master
```
### Switch to main branch and make changes to the hello.sh file
```
git checkout master
```
### Commiting the changes made to the hello.sh file
```
git add hello.sh
```
```
git commit -m "Update hello.sh to greet the user by name"
```
### Merging main into greet branch(Conflict)
```
git checkout greet
```
```
git merge master
```
### Solve conflict manually and commit changes
```
git add hello.sh
```
```
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict by accepting changes from main branch"
```
### Go back to point before the initial merge
```
git log --oneline
```
### Rebasing greet branch
```
git reset --hard 1cad675
```
```
git rebase master
```
* Git will apply the commits from the greet branch on top of the main branch's latest commit. If there any conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause the rebase process, and you'll need to resolve the conflicts manually.

* If there are conflicts, Git will mark the conflicting sections in the affected files. Open the files, resolve the conflicts by choosing the desired changes, and stage the resolved files.

bash
```
git add <resolved-file>  # Replace <resolved-file> with the actual filename
```
After resolving all conflicts, continue the rebase process:

```
git rebase --continue
```
Repeat this process until the rebase is complete.
### Merging greet into main
```
git checkout master
```
```
git merge greet
```


* Fast-forwarding occurs during a merge operation when the base branch that's being merged into has no new commits since the feature branch (the branch being merged) was created or last updated. Instead of creating a new "merge commit," Git simply moves the pointer forward, hence the term "fast forward."

* Git merging refers to Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. On the other hand, git rebase refers to one of two Git utilities designed to integrate changes from one branch onto another. Rebasing is the process of combining or moving a sequence of commits on top of a new base commit. Git rebase is the linear process of merging


# Local and remote repositories
### Make a clone of the repository cloned_hello
```
git clone hello/ cloned_hello
```
### Show logs of cloned_hello
```
cd cloned_hello
```
```
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
### Provide information about the remote repository
```
git remote -v
```
```
git remote show origin
```
### List all remote and local branches
```
git branch -a
```
### Commiting changes
```
git commit -m "Update README.md with Hello World example content"
```
### Fetch changes for cloned_hello
```
git fetch origin
```
### Displaying the logs
```
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```
### Merge changes from the remote main into the local branch
```
git merge origin/master
```
### Add a local branch named greet
```
git checkout -b greet origin/greet
```
### Add remote to git repository
```
git remote add gitea https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/shaokoth/git
```
### Push the main and greet branches to the new route
```
git push gitea master
```
```
git push gitea greet
```
* "What is the single git command equivalent to what you did before to bring changes from remote to local main branch?"
```
git pull origin master
```


# Bare repositories
### Definition bare repository
A bare repository in Git is a repository that doesnâ€™t contain a working directory with the actual files. Instead, it contains only the Git metadata (branches, tags, commit history, etc). Bare repositories are typically used as a central repository for collaboration, where multiple developers push and pull changes. It helps prevent conflicts that could arise if developers pushed to a non-bare repository with a working durectory.
### Create a bare repository
```
cd work
```
### Create
```
git clone --bare /home/shaokoth/git/work/hello hello.git
```
### Add hello.git repository as a remote to the original repository
```
cd hello
```
### Add the bare repository as a remote
```
git remote add bare /home/shaokoth/git/work/hello/he
llo.git
```
### Verify remote was added 
```
git remote -v
``` 
### Commit changes to README.md
```
git add README.md
```
```
git commit -m "updated README.md with new content"
```
### Push the changes to the shared(bare) repository
```
git push bare master
```
### Switch to the cloned_hello
```
cd cloned_hello
```
### Pull the changes from the shared repository
```
git pull origin master
```
